**CUENCAS** is a river networks analysis tool. It is a simplified version of the original GIS called HidroSig, developed by the Water Resources Department at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia over the last 5 years.

In addition to being a DEMs analysis tool, **CUENCAS**, establishes a Data Organization Framework (DOF), that allows different modules to interact with spatially and/or temporarly concurrent data. The DOF is illustrated in greater detail here.

The group of tools currently built into Cuencas can be group as:

  * River Network Extraction from Digital Elevation Models (DEMs)
  * River Network Geomorphologic Analysis including but not limited to:
    1. Topologic and Geometric Width Function
    1. Horton Analysis
    1. Generalized Horton Analysis (Simple scaling of network properties)
    1. Network links analysis (Length, area, slope, etc) including xy-plots for link properties (e.g. Hack's Law)
    1. Area-Altitude
    1. Self-similarity based on the Random Self Similar network (RSN) model.
    1. Scale analysis of spatially distributed variables (Precipitation, Evaporation) in the river network context.

  * Link based rainfall-runoff model
    1. 3D view of the basin
    1. Decomposition of basin into links and hillslopes
    1. Real time flow simulations

  * Water Balance

  * Visualization tools for DEMs
    1. Visualization and Animation tools for Spatial Fields (e.g. precipitation)
    1. Time Series Analysis
    1. Rainfall Fields Simulator
